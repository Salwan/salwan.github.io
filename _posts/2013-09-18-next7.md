Titanfall has taken the gaming world by storm. Every time I've gotten my hands on Respawn Entertainment's latest game I experience something new. It's a game that is fresh, yet familiar to fans of Call Of Duty who might be yearning for more out of their first-person shooters. It's not easy breathing new life into a genre that hasn't had much innovation in the twilight of this console generation. Titanfall certainly has its work cut out for it.
