So I woke up today at 6:00am, left the house and went to [Google's g|egypt 2.0](https://sites.google.com/site/gegypt2011/) Developers event, and here I am home again, only 16 hours of googley awesomeness later :D

On entering you see this, it was a little lonely, but stylish

Inside there are multiple "tracks" each containing different seminars and events, and in between there was the chill out zone, and many other activities, and you had to pass through this Google arc:

The epic chillout zone had all kinds of strange inventions to replace what we know as "chair", also a couple of pong tables, fussball (FUS RODAAH!), recharge stations, drinks, sweets, strange man-made devices everywhere.

The beanbags in particular were exceptionally comfortable, leading to some "accidental" sleep on occasion

We got to see sneak-peaks of some revolutionary Google technologies in development like sci-fi use of voice recognition/google translate, how the new Android OS employed [Near Field Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication), and driverless cars (among many other equally wonderful stuff), felt like Startrek and got to talk to some awesome googlers, I can't express in words how inspired I got to push myself further in my field after witnessing what these guys are creating.

It was an awesome event, even with my 10 hours of painful headache (which is still going) basically turning me into Zombie Developer.. by the last event I was fighting this strange urge in my guts to lift my arms and shout "BRAINZZZZZZZ"..

And, yes.., this is how I saw people most of the time..

Also, Google cake! :3
