Yesterday, I didn’t have internet, I sat down and analyzed what was bad about draft 1 timetable. The things I came up with are as follows:

* It was too restrictive and quite inflexible. Everything depends on how strict I followed the timetable
* It didn’t feel like I have a choice for the whole day
* Some days I have an errand or two which would happen at a random time, sometimes there is an event or a party that I want to go to, either of these would throw the whole timetable off
* There are so many different things to do every week, it causes a bit of confusion, and takes time from the higher priority things.

The only advantage of draft 1 timetable, is the balance between creativity and work. Which I admit felt really good, work is stressing, creativity is letting go. But I’m gonna try not to do that this time.

So I first created draft 2, but didn’t like it. I moved to draft 3, and I think it’s a pretty good balance between choice and using 100% of my time.

This time, I have two types of days, work days and fun days. Following the `work hard, play hard` idea, I should work for 10 hours in work days, and not work at all during fun days!

Every week, I get 5 days of work, and 2 days of fun. It’s up to me to decide what each weekday is, according to my plans and commitments during that week. Furthermore, each type of days has 2 variations to it, I get to choose either variation. This means there is a fair amount of choice in how each week will look like.

I also identified that I don’t sleep 8 hours everyday, most of the times 7 hours. So I used that additional hour as part of the timetable, while giving myself the option to sleep 8 hours if I was tired and needed it that day.

Here’s the timetable of choices:

I also printed a special calendar to keep track of how everyday goes through.

I’m going to Alexandria in a few hours to my family’s place, this is a big test. It’s hard to keep any kind of time management in there.
