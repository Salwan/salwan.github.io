COMPILE60 is a simple front-end written in Python/Tkinter to simplify C compilation and linking of PC-6002 projects.

Installation and usage instructions are in the readme.md file: [compile60git]

COMPILE60 requires [z88dk](https://www.z88dk.org/forum/) to work and of course a PC-6001 emulator for testing.

Limitations:

- At the moment, N66 SR (Mode 6) support is listed but it doesn't exist in z88dk yet (working on it).
- Limited options that don't include more advanced features like optimization

A few planned features to be implemented some day:

- Compiling output directly into a virtual floppy disk image rather than using P6 cassettes
- Embedding support for PNG60 tool to import and compress bitmaps to N66-BASIC
