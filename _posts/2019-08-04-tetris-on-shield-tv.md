Weather not being so nice through this weekend with an upcoming quick 2 weeks vacation where it's summertime, I thought I'll do a fun indoors thing on Saturday.

A while ago I set up [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/) on NVIDIA Shield TV and hooked up a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, the idea is to do some light gamedev directly on the TV while chilling on the couch. It'll be like the most relaxed form of development possible :)

I thought I'll try something very simple, a minimal tetris written as straight forward as possible was what I went with. I enjoyed it thoroughly and how easy and fast developing it on lua was. It only took me a few hours to finish covering all features I wanted. I think this might be the fastest game I've ever finished to date!
