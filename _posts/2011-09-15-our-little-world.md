Watching the little gamedev twitter world, I find notch working on Minecraft and releasing 1.8, Chevy Ray is enthusiastically developing a new game with a bunch of artists, John Carmack like usual mumbling about weird things related to displays and refresh rates, I think he’s creating an intergalactic space ship out of old CRT monitors or something.. whatever it may be, it can probably reach escape velocity..
IndieCade independent games festival is announcing it’s finalists! http://www.indiecade.com/index.php/2011/Finalists/ then accusing notch of causing their website to go down hehe notch is like a living breathing DoS attack
And Terry Cavanagh celebrating because his game “At a distance” is a finalist at indiecrade!
And I’m coding my own little thing, I couldn’t help but smile =) I like this little world, and I want to stay in it..
